In 2019, at Toyota plants, the manufacturing unit worked closely with units responsible for production technology and motive power to conduct energy diagnosis, offer suggestions for improvement, and implement necessary measures at production sites, and by doing so, we pushed energy conservation efforts (internal ESCO activities) and applied good examples to other units on a continuous basis. In addition, energy conservation effects were obtained by introducing a wider range of innovative technology mainly in the painting process and using less steam and air and more LED lighting. Meanwhile, Toyota worked with group companies and suppliers to share know-how in energy conservation so that they could reflect it in their operations for improvement. Furthermore, it strove to introduce renewable energy while taking into account the characteristics of the countries and regions in which it operated. Currently, as typified by the ongoing construction of a 21.5MW wind power plant at the Tahara Plant in Japan, the company is promoting the introduction of power generation equipment using renewable energy at the site of its plants."

This study proposes targets for 2025, 2035 and 2050. To reach these objectives, PSA\xe2\x80\x99 strategy takes into account the following elements, which contribute to reduce influence of some parameters on energy use: - Daily control of energy consumption to identify deviation and implement immediate corrective action - Implementation of processes using less energies, for new processes, but also by improving existing processes - Surface reduction of plants. - Use of an increasing part of renewable energies. With the inclusion of OV activities in 2018, the carbon intensity by revenue significantly increased. However, comparisons with results of previous years and with the plan created in 2016 are not possible. Where CO2 emission profiles of production activities are similar between both companies, the existence of cogeneration plants make a big difference to the amount of emissions, in particular direct emissions, and the improvement actions could not be the same as for production plants.

Many parameters have an influence on the emissions intensity per unit of currency, which, combined, contribute to the change observed. For example: - the &quot;volume effect&quot; on CO2 emissions is not proportional: for a given plant, the change in vehicle output is only partially reflected in the change in CO2 emissions, since part of the energy consumption of a plant (heating, lighting, ...) is not directly proportional to production output; - Groupe Renault operates in many countries, with varied energy mixes. In some cases, Groupe Renault plants have green electricity contracts in place (such as the Tangiers plant in Morocco). Each plant produces only a limited portfolio of vehicles, as low as one model for some plants (such as Dieppe in France), and Groupe Renault has a wide range of vehicle on offer, with a wide range of selling prices. Therefore, there is a complex relation between sales mix, revenue, and distribution of production accross plants (hence, CO2 emissions) which contributes to explain why emissions and revenue are not 100% corelated."

The intensity figure is calculated by dividing emissions from BMW Group production sites by the number of vehicles produced. In particular increase in energy efficiency as well as use of environmentally friendly and economically sustainable energy resources and purchase of electricity produced from regenerative sources helped to reduce the CO2 emissions in production in 2018 by 2.4%.
114,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - Climate Change 2020,0.0000316,3417470,unit total revenue,108187000000,Market-based,3.1,Decreased,"In 2019, FCA revenues decreased by 2.0% (from approximately \xe2\x82\xac110.4 billion in 2018 to \xe2\x82\xac108.2 billion in 2019), primarily due to lower volumes of Maserati and EMEA region. Total GHG emissions decreased by 5.1% (from around 3.6 to 3.4 million tons of CO2) both in Scope 1 and Scope 2, thanks to an additional impact of emission reduction activities (around 4,200 projects) as reported in C4.3b. Please note that FCA published in the 2019 Sustainability Report new restated data for 2018 due to use of residual mix to calculate Market-based figures. If applied to figures reported in past years this restatement would lead to higher emission reduction (-8.6%), and therefore the change from previous year of the Intensity figure would have reached a decrease of 6.7%"
