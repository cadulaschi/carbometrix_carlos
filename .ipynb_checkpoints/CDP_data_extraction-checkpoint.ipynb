We are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. Meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards, especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions. Driven by climate change and other related factors such as air quality and energy security, GHG and fuel consumption standards have become more stringent to meet policy priorities. We anticipate that the number and stringency of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an evolving but un-harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue.', 'Emerging regulation', 'Relevant, always included', 'We see autonomous technology leading towards a future of zero congestion, zero emissions and zero crashes, since more than 90% of crashes are caused by driver error, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We are among the leaders in the industry with significant global real-world experience in delivering connectivity, safety and security services to millions of customers through OnStar, LLC (OnStar) and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that are driving our leadership position in the development of autonomous technology. An example of advanced automation is Super Cruise, a hands-free driving customer convenience feature that is available on the 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan. We are actively testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Warren, Michigan. Additionally, we plan to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S. In November 2017 we announced that our growing fleet of test vehicles will accumulate a significant number of miles in 2018, and based on our current rate of change we expect commercial launch at scale in dense urban environments in 2019. Many of our advanced technologies, including autonomous, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to emerging regulation and evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.', 'Technology', 'Relevant, sometimes included', \"Technology in our products and facilities is included in Climate Change risk assessments on a case by case basis.

Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for free repairs. At present, the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a recall or customer satisfaction action could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like autonomous, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in product delays, recalls, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements, and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.
